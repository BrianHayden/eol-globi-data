Welcome to the *tropic-graph* project.
======================================

This mission of this project is to find efficient ways to normalize and integrate species interaction data to enable researchers and enthusiasts to answer questions like: which species does an Angel Shark ('''Squatina squatina''') eat in the Gulf of Mexico? Please see http://github.com/jhpoelen/trophic-graph/wiki for more information.
